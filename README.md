# Credit Approval System

## Project Overview

The **Credit Approval System** automates the process of evaluating credit applications. The system analyzes the applicant's financial data, such as credit scores, income, employment status, loan amounts, and other relevant factors. Based on this information, the system provides a decision to approve or reject the credit application.

This system is designed to:
- Collect user data through a web interface.
- Process the data using predefined algorithms or machine learning models.
- Return a decision on whether the credit application is approved or rejected.

## Features

1. **User Registration & Login**: 
   - Users can register, log in, and securely apply for credit.
   
2. **Credit Evaluation**: 
   - Based on the user's financial data, the system evaluates eligibility for credit.
   
3. **Risk Assessment**: 
   - The system uses business logic or machine learning algorithms to assess the applicant’s credit risk.
   
4. **Approval/Rejection Notification**: 
   - The system notifies the user of their credit application status.

5. **Data Storage**: 
   - The system stores user data and application status in a database.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django)
- **Frontend**: React.js or any other frontend framework (optional)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Scikit-learn for predictive analysis
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) or OAuth for secure login
- **Version Control**: Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (if using Python backend) or **Node.js** (if using a JavaScript-based backend)
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** or any other database you are using
- **Git** for version control

### Steps to Run the Code

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArunMandava3030/credit_approval_system.git
cd credit_approval_system
```

#### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Python-Based Projects)

For Python-based projects, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

##### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

##### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if using Python) or `package.json` (for Node.js-based projects).

##### Python (Flask/Django):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Node.js (if using Node.js):
```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Set Up the Database

1. **Create a Database**: Set up your database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and configure it by creating a new database for the project.
   
2. **Configure Database Connection**: Add your database credentials in a `.env` file (for Python projects) or `config.js` (for Node.js). Example configuration:

##### Example `.env` file (Python):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/credit_approval
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

##### Example `config.js` (Node.js):

```js
module.exports = {
    db: {
        host: "localhost",
        user: "username",
        password: "password",
        database: "credit_approval"
    },
    secretKey: "your_secret_key"
};
```

#### 5. Run Database Migrations

If you are using an ORM (like SQLAlchemy for Python), you may need to run database migrations to create the necessary tables.

##### For Python (Flask/Django):
```bash
flask db upgrade    # For Flask
# or
python manage.py migrate  # For Django
```

#### 6. Run the Application

##### For Python (Flask/Django):
To start the application in development mode:

```bash
python app.py    # For Flask
# or
python manage.py runserver  # For Django
```

##### For Node.js:
To start the server, use the following:

```bash
npm start
```

#### 7. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000    # For Flask
# or
http://localhost:8000    # For Django
```

#### 8. Test the System

- Register a new user.
- Log in and submit a credit application.
- View the credit approval decision (approved or rejected).

## Additional Information

- **Machine Learning Integration**: If you want to integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis of credit risk, you can use Scikit-learn, train models with real-world financial data, and integrate them into the backend.
  
- **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens or OAuth for secure login and token-based authentication.
  
- **Frontend**: If you want to build a frontend for this project, consider using frameworks like React.js or Angular to build interactive user interfaces.
